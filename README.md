# Transit Accessibility Analyst for ArcGIS Pro

With Transit Accessibility Analyst (TAA), we provide you a one-stop experience of measuring accessibility provided by public transit systems. TAA contains four tools:

1. Create Network Dataset
2. Calculate Impedance and Opportunity
3. Measure Accessibility
4. Update GTFS using Proposed Routes

**_Note_**
- The first tool requires using a [transit network template](datasets/TransitNetworkTemplate.xml) developed by ESRI. For more information, please visit [Network Analyst ArcGIS Pro Tutorial Data](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=c18b87f786c4462fab34ade571f7a025).
